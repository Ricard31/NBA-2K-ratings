** NBA 2K ratings**

NBA 2K is a famous saga of basketball videogames. Each year, a new version of the game is released, with updated players and rosters.

Each player in the NBA is given a numeric rating (from 0 to 100) which indicates how good the player is.

The idea of this project is to understand how this score is given. 

For that, some data will be obtained via web scraping.
